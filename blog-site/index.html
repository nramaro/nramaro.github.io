				<h1> Air Jordan 11 "Concord" </h1>
				<h4>Original 1996 Release</h4>
				
				<div>
				<p> The Air Jordan XI arrived on the scene in 1996, when three colorways of the high-top were introduced, alongside two colorways of a low-cut version known as the "IE."" In 2000, Jordan fans were treated to the I's first-ever retro edition, while women's editions also made their way to market. Rumor has it that the XI was also the reason why Air Jordan Retro releases were moved to Saturdays, as kids often skipped school and cut class to get their hands on a pair.</p>
