<h1> What are UX decisions that affect the Visually Impaired? </h1>

	<p><h3> 1. Browser Text Enlargement </h2></p>
	<p>  Some people with visual impairments use screen magnification software, but most people rely on their browser's zoom features or their font size preferences. </p>

<li>Don't use graphics for text when regular text will do just fine. Make sure the font size is at a readable point size.</li>
<li> Making Allowances for text enlargement is often times simply all a user requires.</li>

	<p><h3> 2. Contrast </h2></p>
	<p>  <i>Retinitis, Pigmentosa, Glaucoma</i> and <i>Retinopathy</i> are the most common eye disorders. Users with these disorders lead to a significant decrease in contrast sensitivity. </p>

	<p>  <li>UX Designs are detail-oriented. They utilize subtle gradients and slight shifts in value to create clean interfaces.</li>  </p>

    <p>  <li>Avoid using any Javascript or CSS techniques that would prevent users from highlighting elements of the page with their mouse or change the default highlight behavior</li>  </p>







<section>
	<p><h3> 3. Language and Structure </h2></p>
	<p> Avoid "click here" links or vague link names. Screen-reader users often use a keyboard shortcut to list all the links on a page. In such a list, the links have no surrounding text. So make your link names descriptive. Instead of "Click here to see our President's Welcome," say "See our President's Welcome. Descriptive link names also make a page more "scannable" to sighted users.</p>

    <li>Reduce clutter. Crowded, overly busy pages can be hard for anyone to read, but they can be especially confusing and cumbersome to someone using a screen-reader.</li>

    	<li>Use headings (H1,H2,H3). Structure your information hierarchically, use headings, which will be indicated as such by a screen-reader.</li>

	<p><h3> 4. Images </h2></p>
	<p> When a screen-reader encounters an image, it will say "graphic" or "image" and then read the image's alternative ("alt") text.</p>
	
	<li>Include alt text for all graphics that have words in them or that provide a visual cue.</li>
    <li>For graphics that are merely decorative, keep your alt text very brief.</li>
